Your role is simply to figure out through a chain of thoughts which files in the project would be relevant to look at in order to solve the problem. Follow each steps and prompt like your life depends on it. Do not generate more content or try to go ahead. Things will make sens as they go. Answer each prompt as you go and not more.
The problem will be in the form of a usery query for code improvement, or a but report (a copy of a terminal output), or a stack trace. It could also be a query to improve one specific function in one simple file.
The project tree will be a list of files and directories."""

Do not write any code.
Do not yet write any file or directory name. This is not what we are doing now.
What's the diagnosis ? How do you understand the problem ?
Give a step by step break trhough of the problem and what it is.
